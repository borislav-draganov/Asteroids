=======
Using the programming language C++ and programming framework Qt write an arcade video game Asteroids.
The program simulates the famous game from 1979 (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_%28video_game%29).
The program interface is fully graphical.

The program must have the following features:
* The game has 10 levels of difficulty. Each level differs in number of asteroids and saucers, randomly placed on the screen by the program;
* The ship is controlled by the user. It can move as described in the link above, and it can shoot forward.
* The program records the best scores;
* Once a level is passed by the user, he/she can play the next level;
* The user can save a game and load previously saved games.
